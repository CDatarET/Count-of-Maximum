# Count of Maximum

## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of length `N`, your task is to find the element which repeats in `A` the maximum number of times as well as the corresponding count.  
In case of ties, choose the **smaller element** first.

---

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains an integer `T`, denoting the number of test cases.
- Then follow the descriptions of `T` test cases.
- Each test case begins with a single integer `N`, the length of array `A`.
- The next line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the array `A`.

---

## Output Format

For each test case, output two space-separated integers `V` and `C`.  
`V` is the value which occurs the maximum number of times and `C` is its count.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
- -10⁶ ≤ A[i] ≤ 10⁶
